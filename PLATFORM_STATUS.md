# BlackNBrownStudios Platform Status

## Overview
The platform monorepo is now set up with shared infrastructure for full-stack game applications.

## Current Structure

### Apps
- **history-time-api** - History Time backend (migrated, needs refactoring)
- **history-time-web** - History Time web app (migrated)
- **history-time-mobile** - History Time React Native app (migrated)
- **dodginballs-api** - DodginBalls backend (migrated, needs refactoring)

### Shared Packages
- **@platform/backend-core** - Express setup, middleware, error handling ✅
- **@platform/auth-backend** - Complete auth system (JWT, OAuth, users) ✅
- **@platform/types** - Shared TypeScript types ✅

### Planned Packages
- **@platform/matchmaking** - Shared matchmaking service
- **@platform/leaderboards** - Unified leaderboard system
- **@platform/teams** - Team/guild management
- **@platform/analytics** - Game analytics
- **@platform/api-client** - Unified API client for frontends

## Migration Status

### History Time
- ✅ All apps copied to platform
- ✅ Package names updated
- ⏳ API needs refactoring to use platform packages
- ⏳ Frontend needs to update imports

### DodginBalls
- ✅ Backend copied to platform
- ✅ Package.json updated
- ⏳ Needs refactoring to use platform packages
- ⏳ Frontend web app to be created

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Refactor History Time API to use platform packages
3. Refactor DodginBalls API to use platform packages
4. Test both APIs work correctly

### Short Term
1. Extract leaderboard logic to shared package
2. Create shared API client package
3. Update frontends to use shared packages
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Long Term
1. Add more games to the platform
2. Create shared analytics dashboard
3. Implement cross-game features
4. Deploy to production infrastructure
